I know this might be an overrated answer but I feel like he always sang or rapped about topics which were in touch with the people such as politics and things which affected the society. You are able to collaborate with any female rapper in the world. Who do you choose and why? Young MA, I feel like she has that extra sauce. She is the benchmark for female rappers as much as she is underrated. The biggest misconception people have of NATE is? That I’m not South African. Half of the people I meet in Joburg think I’m Nigerian. How long does it take you to do your hair every morning? Tricky question. It depends on my mood but it’s usually between 3 to 10 minutes. Sometimes I just wake up and rock. The best sneaker that you own is… ? Air Jordan 10s What is the most important thing you have learnt over the past year? Trusting and believing in myself more than anything else. The meal that most reminds you of your childhood is…? Samp and beans. You are on death row. You are given one last meal and drink. What meal and drink would you choose to have? Mogodu and Lemon twist. Tell us about the worst date you've ever had. Lol, my varsity date. She was modelling and she was the first princess in the varsity and was also a runner-up for Mrs Vaal. There was a night where she was modelling and The Soil was performing at the varsity, she went missing until I left. Worst night ever!!! The Saturday Star
