The mortal remains of Kgothatso Mdunana are finally home after her family waited more than a month to lay their child to rest. Grieving, but relieved family members welcomed the body of the 24 year old at OR Tambo International family following her death on April 30 in China. Mdunana, a former St Stithians College learner, was on the verge of graduating with a degree in Engineering from the University in Shandong, China, allegedly fell through the window of a 13th-floor apartment in Hangzhou, China, while visiting a ‘friend’ on April 30. Neither the family nor Kgothatso’s roommate, Princess, in Qingdao, know the mystery friend she visited and have not been able to speak to the person since the tragedy. Kgothatso’s mother, Nomsa Mdunana said the family received a video from Princess, who received it from the mystery friend, showing that her daughter had fallen to her death. At the time of the devastating news, the family said that Kgothatso was on the verge of graduating from Shandong University of Technology in Qingdao and that there was no way she would “throw” herself out of a window. A memorial service will be held on Thursday at the St Stithians College Chapel in Randburg and she will be laid to rest at the Waterfal Cemetery in Midrand on Saturday.
